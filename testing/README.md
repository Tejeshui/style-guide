# Funkhaus Testing Guide

This is document serves as a checklist of bugs and coding issues we commonly see, along with guidance on how to fix those issues. It should be treated as a checklist before work is presented to Funkhaus. If a site can pass all these tests, then it is ready. Our desire is to push testing down to the contractors where possible. We stole this concept from [Kelly Johnson](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/aeronautics/skunkworks/14rules.html).
